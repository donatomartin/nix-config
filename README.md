# My NixOS Configuration

In this repo you will find all my laptop's non sensible configuration, all the tools and services I have enabled on my daily basis. Most of the functionality is installed in the home-manager so it can be installed in any OS without superuser or admin privileges.

You will also find here my current nixvim configuration along my tmux and hyprland defaults.
